> **"Bridging the gap between Guideline-Based Theory and Real-World Patient Data."**

**Renal Companion** is a specialized clinical informatics platform designed to empower Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) patients with medical-grade tools for nutritional management, lab tracking, and medication safety. Unlike generic fitness trackers, every algorithm in Renal Companion is strictly calibrated to **KDOQI 2024** and **KDIGO** clinical practice guidelines.

## 🚀 Key Innovation: "Clinical Intelligence"

Moving beyond standard probabilistic AI, Renal Companion employs a **Hybrid Inference Model**:
1.  **Deterministic Layer:** A hard-coded clinical rule engine (Clinically-Constrained Grammar) that prevents "hallucinations" in nutrient calculations (Potassium, Phosphorus, Sodium).
2.  **Probabilistic Layer:** An AI assistant (Murshid AI) that synthesizes complex medical advice within strict safety guardrails.

## 🌟 Core Features

*   **Offline-First Architecture:** Complete data privacy with local-only storage (Isar NoSQL). No PHI leaves the device.
*   **Renal-Specific Logic:** Automated calculation of `eGFR` (CKD-EPI 2021), `Adjusted Body Weight (AjBW)`, and `Dialysis Protein Needs`.
*   **Vision-Based Auditing:** Scan grocery labels to detect hidden "Inorganic Phosphorus" additives.
*   **Intervention Tracking:** Correlate dietary adherence with monthly lab trends (e.g., "See how your Phosphorus binder intake reduced PO4 levels").

## 🛠️ Technical Architecture

Built by a **Senior Full-Stack Architect**, the system exemplifies modern software engineering standards:
*   **Framework:** Flutter (Dark/Light mode native).
*   **State Management:** BLoC (Business Logic Component) for predictable state flows.
*   **Database:** Isar (High-performance NoSQL) with fully ACID transactions.
*   **Code Structure:** Strict **Clean Architecture** (Presentation → Domain → Data) ensuring testability and scalability.
